# Diamond Price Prediction using Open Source Machine Learning

## Overview
Welcome to the **Diamond Price Prediction** project! This repository contains a comprehensive solution for predicting the prices of diamonds using open-source machine learning techniques. This project aims to provide insights into diamond pricing by leveraging data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning models.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the diamond dataset.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Gain insights from the data through visualizations and statistical analysis.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create meaningful features to improve model performance.
- **Model Training**: Train machine learning models to predict diamond prices.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate and compare the performance of different models.
